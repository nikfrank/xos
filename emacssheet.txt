This here is your emacs cheet sheet. It covers basic key bindings which you will use.

Note on reading key bindings: C is the ctrl key (even for mac users) S is shift, M is alt

C-x C-s means "hold ctrl - hit x, hold ctrl - hit s", holding ctrl the whole time is cool

incidentally, that's how you save your work, so feel free to develop trigger finger on C-x C-s

Note on undo/cut/copy/paste:

emacs predates the invention of C-z = undo, C-x = cut, C-c = copy, C-v = paste and thus doesn't use them.
There's a setting in one of the menus that you can turn those on, I use the emacs key bindings, nbd.


BASICS::

C-w          "wipe"           equivalent to cut
C-y          "yank"           equivalent to paste
M-w                           equivalent to copy
C-w C-y     "wipe","yank"     also the same as copy, doesn't use M
C-_                           undo

C-x d            using the minibuffer (bottom bar) opens directory listing (hit enter)
                 while in the directory listing, hit RET (the enter key) to go into a file
		 .. means "up" one directory (as is standard in unix)
		 hit g to refersh the listing
		 the files that end in ~ are buffer files emacs uses. feel free to ignore them
		                         so long as you save your work all the time.


C-g            cancels current operation, reverses direction of undo -> redo, redo -> undo.

C-k            cuts the rest of the line
C-a            moves cursor to beginning of line

C-<left>       moves cursor left one word
C-<right>      moves cursor right one word

C-<up>	       move cursor up one paragraph
C-<down>       move cursor down one paragraph

C-<home>       move cursor to beginning of file
C-<end>	       move cursor to end of file

<tab>	       properly indents current line/selected lines (super useful. hit it often)

C-s	       search -> type into minibuffer, continue hitting C-s
C-r	       reverse search, same as search (can be used with C-s to search back and forth)

C-<backspace>  cut beginning of or previous word (" " , . / () {} [] ; and some other stuff end words)
C-<delete>     cut rest of or next word

MULTIBUFFER::

These key bindings let you split your screen, in order to have many files open at once

C-x 2          Split buffer vertically
C-x 3	       Split buffer horizontally

C-x o	       move cursor to next buffer

C-x 0	       close current buffer
C-x 1	       make this buffer the only one (close all other buffers in this window)

C-x 5 2	       open another window

C-x C--     (that's ctrl-minusSign) shrink text size. (can repeat C-- without repeating C-x)
C-x C-+	    grow tex size (can repeat C-- C-+ at will to fiddle text size)


There are a bazillion more functions and key bindings built into emacs, google away.
One that I find useful is called "replace-regexp" and is available from M-x -> (name of function)


MY CUSTOM KEY BINDINGS::

these are mostly useful for writing javascript, feel free to go into the .emacs file and edit them

C-S-<return>   duplicate current line

C-<tab>        console.log(); move cursor into parens
C-f	       open a function with parens and curlies, move cursor into parens
C-{	       open spaced curlies {
	       	    // moves rest of line into curlies (to convert inline if/for into block
}	       

	      
C-$	      $scope.     (for angularjs)

C-!	      turn html tag into comment
C-~	      turn html comment into tag
C-<	      open new html comment
C->	      turn text on line into open and close tag (div -> <div>\n\n</div>)
