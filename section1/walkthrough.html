<p>
  here's a demo lesson on a super simple app I just wrote
</p>
<p>
  there's a bug in the calculator! it works for - / and *, but adding is crazy!
</p>
<p>
  try using the typeof keyword on the input values (console.log the result)
</p>
<p>
  see if you can find the soln now! if not
  <code>git checkout hint2</code>
