<p>
  here's a demo lesson on a super simple app I just wrote
</p>
<p>
  there's a bug in the calculator! it works for - / and *, but adding is crazy!
</p>
<p>
  what's happening is the "+" operator has a different meaning for numbers as for strings
  ((code blurb here))
</p>
<p>
  and since we aren't telling angular what type to expect, it guesses wrong
</p>
<p>
  the other operators work because they're only defined for numbers.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
  so there's two ways of fixing this:: from the view or the controller
</p>
<p>
  we can either put a type="number" attribute on the input boxes
</p>
<p>
  or we can parse the input into an integer in the add function
</p>
